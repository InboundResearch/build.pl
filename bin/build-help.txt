HELP: build <target> <configuration> <command>

build is a tool for building c/c++ code projects with minimal setup and
configuration. it is a bash shell script that works in conjunction with the
build.pl perl script, so it can be run in any command line environment that
supports bash (4+) and a threaded version of perl (5+). build will exit if any
error is encourntered while performing the requested operations.

see the github repository at https://github.com/brettonw/build.pl for details.

<target>
    is one (or more) of the targets in the source directory. setting any target
    sets the build flag. the default behavior is to get the default target from
    the build.json file (and that default is "*", or all). there is a special
    command line option to set the build target:

    -all                build (or run) all targets in the source directory.

<configuration>
    is any one of the configurations defined for the project. only one value is
    permitted, and the last one given will be used. build.pl defines a default
    set of configurations to include "debug" and "release". setting a
    configuration sets the build flag.

<command>
    there are two types of commands: immediate, and deferred. immediate commands
    are executed when encountered in the command line, and the program exits.
    deferred commands set a value, or a flag to perform requested operations
    during the build step. deferred commands are not queued.

    immediate commands are:
    -----------------------

    -help               print this message, and exit.

    -cloc               run the project tool to count lines of code in the
                        source directory, and exit.

    -configurations     print a list of valid configurations for the project,
                        and exit.

    -defines            print a list of preprocessor defines that are available
                        to all sources, and exit. this is useful when examining
                        compiler characteristics, or when developing code to
                        work across multiple platforms.

    -targets            print a list of valid targets (in dependency order) for
                        the project, and exit.

    deferred commands are (in the order the operations are performed):
    ----------------------

    -pull               set a flag to run the project tool to pull, or synch,
                        sources from the source code management (SCM) system.
                        the default behavior is a simple git pull.

    -clean              set a flag to run the project tool to remove build
                        artifacts from the project tree. the default behavior
                        removes the build directory.

    -build              indicates the tool should run a build step on the
                        specified targets. the default value if not specified is
                        to build, but other commands set or clear this command.
                        for example, -clean clears the build flag to enable a
                        simple clean-only build operation. setting any target
                        will automatically set the build flag. if any of the
                        targets fail to build, the build tool will exit.

    -run                set a flag to run the targets. this step is completed
                        after all targets are successfully built. setting the
                        run flag implies -build. if any of the targets fails to
                        run, or returns EXIT_FAILURE, the build tool will exit.

    -push               set a flag to run the project tool to push, or checkin,
                        sources to the source code management (SCM) system. the
                        push operation is performed after a successful build,
                        and run (if requested), but before the deploy operation.
                        the default is a simple git add-commit-push.

    -deploy             set a flag to run the project tool to deploy the built
                        project. the deploy operation is performed only after
                        all other steps complete successfully. the default
                        behavior is to do nothing, set this option in your
                        build.json file for the project if you want to use it.

EXAMPLES:
    > build
        this simple command will attempt to build the project default target.

    > build -clean
        this simple command will perform a clean step and exit

    > build -pull -clean -run -all

    > build -clean -run -all release

    > build -run myprogram
